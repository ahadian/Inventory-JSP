Inventory-JSP
=============

Small Java project that uses JSP and SQL to perform operations on an Inventory (Database). Consists of two types of operations - Admin and User. Atleast one admin account should be created by default during the creation of database.
This example uses Microsoft Access as the database. It can be changed to MySQL or Oracle easily by using the appropriate drivers in the "ConnectionDAO" class.
